Recall :

1) All primes (except 2) are odd numbers, ie. 2k+1
2) Primes end with 1, 3, 7, 9, ie. 10*k+11, 10*k+3, 10*k+7, 10*k+9
3) Odd numbers are primes if when ending with :
     a) 1 , are not a product like (10*k+7)(10*k+3) or (10*k+11)(10*k+11) or (10*k+9)(10*k+9)
     b) 3 , are not a product like (10*k+3)(10*k+11) or (10*k+7)(10*k+9) 
     c) 7 , are not a product like (10*k+7)(10*k+11) or (10*k+3)(10*k+9)
     d) 9 , are not a product like (10*k+3)(10*k+3) or (10*k+9)(10*k+11) or (10*k+7)(10*k+7)
